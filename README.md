## About
[FINCHES](https://github.com/idptools/finches/tree/main) is a Python package for computing mean-field local and global intermolecular interactions between disordered protein regions. This repository is a central location for a collection of colab notebooks making it easy for folks to perform IDR-centric intermolecular analysis.

FINCHES is the software implementation associated with following paper:

Ginell, G. M., Emenecker, R. J., Lotthammer, J. M., Keeley, A. T., Plassmeyer, S. P., Razo, N., Usher, E. T., Pelham, J. F. & Holehouse, A. S. Sequence-based prediction of intermolecular interactions driven by disordered regions. Science 388, eadq8381 (2025).


### How to use:
* FINCHES is available as a set of Google colab notebooks (as described here)
* FINCHES is available as a [stand-alone Python package](https://github.com/idptools/finches/)
* FINCHES is available as a webserver at [https://www.finches-online.com/](https://www.finches-online.com/)

  
## Notebook request

### [Intermap prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/idptools/finches-colab/blob/main/finches_intermap.ipynb)
This notebook lets you predict an intermap between two sequences, with a few settings to modulate visualization.

### [Epsilon prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/idptools/finches-colab/blob/main/finches_epsilon.ipynb)
This notebook lets you predict the mean-field epsilon value between two sequences.

## Changelog
* [**May 2025**] - Added [finches_epsilon.ipynb](finches_epsilon.ipynb) notebook.
