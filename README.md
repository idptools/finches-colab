# finches-colab
Repository that links notebooks for performing online predictions using FINCHES.

## About
[FINCHES](https://github.com/idptools/finches/tree/main) is a Python package for computing mean-field local and global intermolecular interactions between disordered protein regions. This repository is a central location for a collection of colab notebooks making it easy for folks to perform IDR-centric intermolecular analysis.

FINCHES is the software implementation associated with the pending preprint:

**Direct prediction of intermolecular interactions driven by disordered regions**

Garrett M. Ginell, Ryan. J Emenecker, Jeffrey M. Lotthammer, Emery T. Usher, Alex S. Holehouse

## Notebook request
If there's a specific analysis you would like to perform please let us know and we will generate the associated colab notebook!
